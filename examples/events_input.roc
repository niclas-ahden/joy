## `encodeEvent` does not take an `Event` because `Event`s may have payloads that don't make sense
## to pass in when encoding. In this example we want the event `UserTypedSomething` to trigger
## on input in the textarea. The event will be triggered with the content of the texarea as its
## payload. If `encodeEvent` took `Event` we would have to pass in some nonsense payload above.
##
## Regrettably, this means that the tag `UserTypedSomething` _looks_ like an `Event` but it's
## not. It's just a tag that happens to look similar to the `Event` `UserTypedSomething Str`.
## Therefore, Roc cannot guarantee that we have written a decoder for every tag that we have an
## encoder for.
